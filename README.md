# Stroop_sentence_interleaved

Created in Feb 2020. Wrote on PCIbex (https://doc.pcibex.net/)

A self-paced reading task interleaving with the Stroop task. English Interleaved Stroop and SPR tasks that were modified and combined from Hsu & Novick (2016) and Fine & Jaeger (2016)

Experimental design: 

2 previous-trial congruency (congruent Stroop vs. incongruent Stroop) x 2 current-trial ambiguity (ambiguous sentence vs. unambiguous sentence). 

Conditions:

(CA): Congruent Stroop to ambiguous sentence<br />
(IU): Incongruent Stroop to unambiguous sentence<br />
(IA): Incongruent Stroop to ambiguous sentence<br />
(CU): Congruent Stroop to unambiguous sentence<br />

Examples:

(CA): blue (in blue ink) — Some rescue workers advised about the avalanche decided to stand by.<br />
(IU): Red (in blue ink) — Some rescue workers who were advised about the avalanche decided to stand by.<br />
(IA): Red (in blue ink) — Some rescue workers advised about the avalanche decided to stand by.<br />
(CU): Blue (in blue ink) — Some rescue workers who were advised about the avalanche decided to stand by.<br />

The experiment was eventually done in Gorilla. The study was presented in the 34th Annual CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing.
